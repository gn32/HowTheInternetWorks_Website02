            <h3>Domain name registrations </h3>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>Domain name registrations are overseen by an organization called ICANN (Internet Corporation for
                Assigned Names and Numbers). ICANN specifies which domain name extensions are available and keeps a
                centralized database of where the domain names point to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every website that you visit effectively consists of two main elements: a domain name and a web server.
            </p>
            <p>
                1. A web server is a physical machine that hosts the files and the databases that your website is made
                from
                and sends them out to people across the internet when they visit your site from their machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. The domain name is what people type in to access your site, and it points the web browser to the
                server
                that stores those resources. Without a domain name, people would need to remember the specific IP
                address
                of your server â€” and that is just not going to happen.

            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <h3>Types of Domain names</h3>
            <p>
                1. <strong>Generic Top-Level Domain Names:</strong>
                These domain name extensions began to appear in the 1980's, and now include: .com, .net, .mobi, etc.
                Anyone can register
                a domain name under this extension, but these domains have restricted use.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. <strong>Country Code Top-Level Domain Names:</strong>
                There are generic top-level extensions at a national level, which based on a code depending on the
                country, such as:
                France -.fr, Romania-.ro, United Kingdom-.uk, etc. National entities are responsible with the
                administration of these specific country codes.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. <strong>Internationalized Domain Names:</strong>
                An IDN is an Internet domain name that uses the latest ICANN protocols and standards to support domain
                names written in
                multiple scripts and languages (non-ASCII characters).
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <h3>How is Domain name Organized?</h3>
            <p>
                Basically, a domain names consists of an alphanumeric string which is divided into sections, with the
                most
                important sections separated by periods. For instance, if we take "icannwiki.org" the most important
                sections of this domain name are:
            </p>
            <p>
            <li>
                The highest level of the domain name, known as the Top-Level Domain is found at the far right; in this
                case
                it is the ".org" string.
            </li>
            <li>
                The TLD could have subdivisions, but in this case the information immediate to the left is the
                Second-Level Domain, represented by "icannwiki".
            </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                A domain name is organized from right to left, with the specific descriptions in the left part of the
                domain name while the general descriptors are in the right part. The machine name (WWW) is positioned at
                the far left. Dots are used in order to separate the domain levels.

            </p>
            <h3>What Does ICANN Do?</h3>
            <p>
                To reach another person on the Internet you have to type an address into your computer -- a name or a
                number
                . That address must be unique so computers know where to find each other. ICANN coordinates these unique
                identifiers across the world. Without that coordination, we would not have one global Internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                In more technical terms, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) helps
                coordinate
                the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions, which are key technical services critical to
                the
                continued operations of the Internet's underlying address book, the Domain Name System (DNS). The IANA
                functions include:
            </p>
            <p>1. the coordination of the assignment of technical protocol parameters including the management of the \
                address and routing parameter area (ARPA) top-level domain;
            <p>2. the administration of certain responsibilities associated with Internet DNS root zone management
                such as generic (gTLD) and country code (ccTLD) Top-Level Domains;
            </p>
            <p>
                3. the allocation of Internet numbering resources; and other services.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <h3>How Does ICANN Work?</h3>
            <p>
                Besides providing technical operations of vital DNS resources, ICANN also defines policies for how the
                "names and numbers" of the Internet should run. The work moves forward in a style we describe as the
                "bottom-up, consensus-driven, multi-stakeholder model:"
            </p>
            <p>
            <li>
                Bottom up. At ICANN, rather than the Board of Directors solely declaring what topics ICANN will address,
                members of sub-groups in ICANN can raise issues at the grassroots level. Then, if the issue is worth
                addressing
                and falls within ICANN's remit, it can rise through various Advisory Committees and Supporting
                Organizations
                until eventually policy recommendations are passed to the Board for a vote.
            </li>
            <li>
                Consensus-driven. Through its Bylaws, processes, and international meetings, ICANN provides the arena
                where all
                advocates can discuss Internet policy issues. Almost anyone can join most of ICANN's volunteer Working
                Groups, assuring broad representation of the world's perspectives. Hearing all points of view, searching
                for mutual interests, and working toward consensus take time, but the process resists capture by any
                single
                interestâ€“ an important consideration when managing a resource as vital as the global Internet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Multistakeholder model. ICANN's inclusive approach treats the public sector, the private sector, and
                technical experts as peers. In the ICANN community, you'll find registries, registrars, Internet Service
                Providers (ISPs), intellectual property advocates, commercial and business interests, non-commercial and
                non-profit interests, representation from more than 100 governments, and a global array of individual
                Internet users. All points of view receive consideration on their own merits. ICANN's fundamental belief
                is that all users of the Internet deserve a say in how it is run.
